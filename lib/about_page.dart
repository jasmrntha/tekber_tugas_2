So, here's the storyâ€”my family and I went to a family event early in the morning and got home late at night. Nobody felt like eating by then, so the rice just sat there overnight. The next morning, my little brother had the brilliant idea of reheating it. When I sniffed it, I could already tell it smelled funky, but I went ahead and made fried rice with it anyway. By that night, both my brother and I were doubled over with stomach aches and throwing up. Lesson learned!",
